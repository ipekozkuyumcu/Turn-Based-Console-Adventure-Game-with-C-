# Turn-Based-Console-Adventure-Game-with-C#

This console game project is a combat game. The player will be a mage and encounter monsters one by one in an endless dungeon. The player has five different actions to perform on each turn. After each victory, the player levels up and will choose a skill reward to improve. The game will end when the player quits or is defeated, and the score will be the total number of monsters slain. Additionally, monsters will get stronger after each turn.

Player actions:
1- Sword Attack -- Directly damages the enemy.
2- Magic Strike (costs mana) -- Directly damages the enemy.
3- Healing Spell (Costs Mana) -- Restores health to the player.
4- Poison Spell (Costs Mana) -- Poisons the current enemy, applies damage, and prevents player to be damaged for that turn.
5- Meditate -- Restores mana to the player.

Enemy Abilities:
1- Apply damage (regular damage, increases each turn for the same enemy and also each enemy becomes stronger)
2- Magic resistance (randomly occurs while enemies spawning)
